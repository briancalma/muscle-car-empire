            <div class="home-about-textbox"></div>
            <p> Fiat Chrysler's go-fast SRT brand offers some serious horsepower-per-dollar bargains, and at the top of that list is the SRT 392. For under $50,000, buyers are treated to not only a 485 horsepower and a 475 pound-feet of torque, but a zero to 60 time of 4.2 seconds, as well as a trip down the quarter mile in about 12 seconds. You can even get a cool retro shaker hood, complete with air intake sticking out of it. if you need four doors, Dodge offers the 392 in the Charger, too.</p>
