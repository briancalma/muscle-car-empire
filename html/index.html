		<p>
		According to Muscle Cars, a book written by Peter Henshaw, a "muscle car" is "exactly what the name implies. It is a product of the American car industry adhering to the hot rodder's philosophy of taking a small car and putting a large-displacement engine in it. The Muscle Car is Charles Atlas kicking sand in the face of the 98 horsepower weakling."[7] Henshaw further asserts that the muscle car was designed for straight-line speed, and did not have the "sophisticated chassis", "engineering integrity", or "lithe appearance" of European high-performance cars.
        In the United States, lightweight cars featuring high-performance engines were termed "supercar" before the classification of muscle car became popular. For example, the 1957 Rebel's "potent mill turned the lightweight Rambler into a veritable supercar. "From the mid-sixties to the mid-seventies, what we now think of as muscle cars were more commonly called 'Supercars,' often (though not always) spelled with a capital S.This term described the "dragstrip bred" affordable mid-size cars of the 1960s and early 1970s that were equipped with large, powerful V8 engines and rear-wheel-drive."In 1966, the supercar became an official industry trend"as the four domestic automakers "needed to cash in on the supercar market" with eye-catching, heart-stopping cars.Examples of the use of the supercar description for the early muscle models include the May 1965 Car Life road test of the Pontiac GTO along with how "Hurst puts American Motors into the Supercar club with the 390 Rogue"(the SC/Rambler) to fight in "the Supercar street racer gang" market segment.Moreover, the "SC" in the model name stood for "SuperCar".<br/><br/>
        The need for fast cars started with prohibition in the 1920s.  Moonshiners and bootleggers wanted to be able to outrun police vehicles, so they started modifying their cars.  As the years passed and prohibition ended, the Southern moonshiners became infamous for their modified cars.  The moonshiners transformed their cars due to the demand for speed, handling, and cargo capacity.  By the 1940s, these cars progressed to be more efficient.  The moonshining business was not nearly as profitable as it was during prohibition; the moonshiners started to use their cars for racing.  These remodeled cars dominated the street racing circuits and thus inspired the Oldsmobile Rocket 88.<br/><br/>
        The muscle car industry took off over the 1950s.  The Rocket 88 was soon surrounded by competition.  Two significant contributions to the industry were the Chrysler Corporation Hemi and the Chevrolet small-block V8.  A Hemi is a series of V8 engines with a hemispherical combustion chamber originally made by Chrysler in 1951.  A hemispherical combustion chamber basically has the valves of the cylinders facing each other improving the engine’s airflow capacity and yielding a higher power output.  Chrysler coined and marketed the term “Hemi,” but other automakers have developed similar designs.  The Hemi was introduced the 1955 Chrysler C-300, giving it 300hp and its historic name.  The C-300 became known as “America’s Most Powerful Car.”<br/><br/>
        The momentum of the muscle car industry came to a momentary stop when the Automobile Manufacturers Association decided to put a ban on factory-sponsored racing in 1957.  Manufacturers would not advertise performance-related components of their passenger cars, publicize results, or associate their vehicles with auto racing in any way.  The ban was in response to an accident at the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans race.  Pierre Levegh, driving a Mercedes-Benz, brushed another car, sending him crashing into the stands at 150mph.  The car’s fuel tank ruptured and the car exploded into flames.  The combustion along with rocketing car fragments resulted in 84 deaths including that of Pierre Levegh.  This is known as the most catastrophic accident in motorsports history.  Mercedes-Benz stopped racing that year and returned to the track 32 years later.  Switzerland banned auto racing and lifted the ban only recently in 2007.  When the Automobile Manufacturers Association met in 1957, the president of GM, Harlow Curtice, suggested a self-imposed auto racing ban.  The industry anticipated this ban would pre-empt the government from imposing racing regulations.  However, the automakers involved in the Automobile Manufacturers Association could not keep up with competition from non-association carmakers, and the ban was lifted in 1963.
