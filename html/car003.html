            <h2>About the Car</h2>
            <div class="home-about-textbox"></div>
            <p> The Equus Bass 770 (pronounced like bass guitar, not the fish) brings serious speed and power to the table-for a very wealthy few. Boasting a supercharged 6.2-liter V8 engine borrowed from the C6 Corvette ZR1, the bass 770 makes 640 horsepower and 605 pound-feet of tourque, while reaching a speed of 60 miles per hour in just 3.4 seconds. But with plans to build just 3.4 seconds. But with plans to build just 250 of these (as of 2015), chances are you probably won't be seeing a Bass at your local drag strip anytime soon.<br/>
			     The car's exterior design was inspired by many classic muscle cars of the 1970s. These included the Chevrolet Camaro, the Dodge Challenger, the Dodge Charger, the Plymouth Barracuda, the Pontiac GTO, the Ford Mustang, and the AMC Marlin.[2]
               The interior also sports a vintage look, with retro-spec gauges, switches and steering wheel, while still maintaining a modern aspect with many LED components used for the exterior and modern technology (such as an infotainment system and a GPS navigation system along with parking sensors) used for the interior.[3]
