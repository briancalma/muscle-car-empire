            <p> Everything you wanna know about the precious muscle cars of the past and present generation is here.. enjoy browsing our prestigous gallery of what dominates the road..<br/><br/>
				Now. let's dig deeper fellas.. I know you wanted to know more about Muscle Cars.<br/><br/>
				In the middle of the twentieth century, American car manufacturers had a new vision for the automobile. Highways were etching their way across the states, and by the 1950s, family cars were a staple of the suburban home. But things began to change in the 1960s. With more demand on performance, cars went from high-powered suburban cruisers to lean, mean racing machines. Engines got bigger, bodies got lighter, and doors were stripped-down from 4 to 2.

				By the 1960s, American sports cars were embracing attitude, getting more brazen and ferocious. Names like “Mustang,” “Charger,” and “Barracuda” promised to be a terror on the track (and the streets). And while muscle cars may have reached their “golden age” in the ‘60s, they’re just as popular over 5 decades later, a staple of the highway, and a piece of the American zeitgeist. They’re time capsules, really — a testament to America’s vision, ingenuity, and ambition.

				Let’s take a road trip through America’s automotive history to discover some of the lesser-known facts about muscle cars.<br/><br/>
				The first muscle car was released in 1949<br/><br/>

				Before the term “muscle car” was even conceived, Oldsmobile shot for the stars with their sporty-yet-powerful Rocket 88. With a V8 engine, the Rocket offered a relatively scaled-back body, about a foot shorter than its 98-series counterpart. Plus, rumor has it that GM execs actually hated the name “Rocket.” Nevertheless, it was a smash success and the line continued to sell all the way through 1999. Perhaps the company had tapped into America’s budding fascination with space travel, which soon exploded in the 1950s. (The cinema would be filled with titles like Destination Moon and The Day the Earth Stood Still in following years.)

				Fun fact: In 1951, the Rocket was immortalized in the song “Rocket 88” by the band Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats. Some consider it to be the very first rock ‘n’ roll record.

              <h3>Dodge Charger R/T</h3>
              <p>The R/T trim is shorthand for road or track use, which you could conceivably manage in this high-performance model. Lift the hood on a 2014 Dodge Charger R/T and you’ll find a 370-hp Hemi® V8 glaring back at you, all torquey and mean-sounding. Look inside this four-door sedan, as we did in our Dodge Charger vs. Dodge Avenger article, and you’ll find it packed with features like leather seats, a sunroof, and a heated steering wheel.</p>

              <h3>Ford Mustang GT</h3
              <p>The GT Mustang is a mighty machine, and it’s been in production longer than the other two cars on this short list. That’s saying something about its popularity with drivers. First introduced for 1965, the modern version now has many times the horsepower of the original. The 2016 Ford Mustang GT’s 5.0L, 435-hp V8 hurries you to 60 mph in 4.3 seconds (says Car and Driver).That’s about as fast as you can shift through the manual gearbox’s six gears.</p>

              <h3>Chevrolet Camaro SS</h3>
              <p>The SS stands for Super Sport, and it’s the beefiest trim available for Camaro fans. A 2017 Chevrolet Camaro SS puts a whopping 455 hp under your right foot and gives you 20-inch-plus alloy wheels and an available six-speed transmission. In our Ford Mustang vs. Chevrolet Camaro article, we shared more about the Camaro and its decades-long competition with the Ford Mustang.</p>

              <h3>Chevrolet Camaro LS</h3>
              <p>The LS-trim Camaro is plenty powerful for most drivers. The big, 3.6L V6 under the hood of a 2015 Chevrolet Camaro LS makes a very-respectable 323 hp (and at 278 ft-lbs of torque, gives lots of grunt off the line). And a six-speed manual transmission is available, to help max out your driving thrills.</p>

              <h3>Dodge Charger SXT</h3>
              <p>The 2015 Dodge Charger SXT comes with heated and cooled front seats, in addition to a V6 that puts out 292 hp. This trim is also available with all-wheel drive! This Charger is a big, slab-sided, four-door sedan with an imposing exterior. But inside it’s all comfy, with a heated steering wheel, front leather seats, and thoughtful driver aids like automatic cruise control and lane departure warning.</p>

              <h3>Dodge Challenger SXT</h3>
              <p>Trims like the 2014 Dodge Challenger SXT are sharp and aggressive-looking, and squeeze 305 hp from their 3.6L, six-cylinder engines. They ride on tall, 20-inch-plus alloy wheels, and give you some sharp features the original 1970s Challenger never had, including traction control and Bluetooth® compatibility.</p>
